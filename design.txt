---- Overview: ----

Puzzle Slider Game is a combination puzzle where a player slide pieces vertically or horizontally on a board 
to establish an end result that matches a solution. This project uses python turtle only as graphic packages 
for the application. 


---- Design: ----

I decided to use three classes: Boardlayout, Puzzleclicks, and Leaderboard.

Boardlayout: I wrote this class first which is responsible for static graphics of the game such as window setup, 
layout of three areas (play area, leaderboard area, and control area), as well as splash screen and pop up images 
when player loses, wins, or quits the game.

Puzzleclicks: In this class, I managed the puzzle file reader, puzzle creator, thumbnail creator, and move counter. 
The puzzle_data method take in the puzzle file and build dictionary with data extracted from the file. When a new file 
is loaded, update the puzzle and the thumbnail to match user's selection. Record player's number of moves. I also used 
shuffled list to keep track of the piece order and swap the positions of the list elements when swapping a puzzle piece.

Leaderboard: I create four methods to save/retrieve and present the contents in the leaderboard.

Following the sample work plan, I finally wrote the code to log errors to 5001_puzzle.err, clean up code again and 
continue to test until the program works all fine.
